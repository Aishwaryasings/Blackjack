#All the things I need to make a blackjack game
#1) a deck of cards - array of 1 to 10 with enough 10s to correspond to kings and queens and jacks)
#3) player points - int
#4) player hit - boolean 

#gotta keep going through the game until player stops hitting or points > 18 or less than 21
#ask player to play hit or stay 
#pick random card from deck 
#calculate points
# if greater than 18 < 21: won! break 
# if greater than 21: lose! break
