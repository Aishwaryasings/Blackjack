# Blackjack
This is a tiny blackjack game I made 

Iterations

First round = win if get over 18 but less than 
21, ace is just one 

Second round = win if get over 18 but less than 21, print out 
king, queen, jack, ace is just one

3rd round = win if get over 18 but les than 21, 
ace can be 1 or 11 --> have to decide before 

4th round = add dealer deck 
dealer will only hit as many times as user
and will stop hitting if greater than 16
will win if greater than dealer 
and doesn't bust
